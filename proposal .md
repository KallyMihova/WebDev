### IV.Story
###### Xavier, the penguin has been locked up in a prison for the past 4 years, restricted from doing the only thing he loves: dancing.
###### Even though this penguin got in trouble because of excessive dancing in a public place, nothing can stop him now: He's kept his moves hidden for too long!
###### Take Xavier's place, get your moves ready and dance your way out of this prison!

### V.Esthetics

* 80's Funk Music

### VI.Gameplay
##### Controls:
###### The player will have the usual platformer controls as well as be able to make different combinations and use those as attacks.
* A & D = left and right
* Space = Jump
* Space*2 = Double jump
* Hold down Alt + A/D to slide in that direction
* Etc. 
----
##### Onboarding:
###### The player will have to go through a tutorial level where most basic movements are taught, however for the Special Moves and Combos the player will have In-level experiences with pop-up messages appearing when the specific skill is learned.

##### Important!:
##### The game cannot be passed with the simple moves only. Using Combos and Special Moves enables the player to attack or dodge in different ways, gives extra points and more Special Effects are shown!:+1:
